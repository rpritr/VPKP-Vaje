# Exercise 2: OSINT ‚Äì collecting information about individuals online

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is information sources that are publicly available, for example: websites, social networks, forums, search engines. In this exercise, we will look at how even the average Internet user can access another person's personal information if it is not properly protected.

# üß™ Basics of OSINT

OSINT represents intelligence from open sources, and as a technique it represents the collection and analysis of information that is publicly available through open and legal sources.

OSINT is based on the principle that a huge amount of data can be found on the Internet and other public media that can be used for various purposes ‚Äì from cybersecurity, ethical hacking, to journalism, research and security investigations.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction: Collecting information about individuals online

The objectives of the exercise are:
‚úÖ Learn about OSINT techniques for collecting publicly available information about individuals.
‚úÖ Awareness of how much personal data can be found online.
‚úÖ Discussion on how to protect ourselves from overexposure.

### Tools for collecting information about individuals

Sherlock is an OSINT tool that searches for usernames on over 300 social networks and online platforms. It allows you to enter a username as a string, and the tool checks if there are profiles with that name on known websites.

Maigret goes one step further than Sherlock, as in addition to searching for usernames, it offers a detailed analysis of an individual's digital footprint, including additional metadata and often also the activity of user accounts.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activity: OSINT - Collecting information about an individual

Choose a public figure (e.g. a famous journalist, politician, athlete) or a fictitious person with pre-prepared data for training (it is recommended to use anonymized data to respect privacy).

### üñ•Ô∏è Sherlock

üî∑ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment preparation

Sherlock is a tool that runs in a shell with Python installed.

‚úÖ If you work in a Linux environment (e.g. Kali), Sherlock is often already installed or install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git
cd sherlock
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Sherlock:

```bash
python3 sherlock <username>
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Maigret

üî∑ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative or supplement to Sherlock

Maigret, like Sherlock, runs in a shell with Python installed. It also supports a web interface and various output and report formats.

‚úÖ Installing Maigret (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install maigret
```
or from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soxoj/maigret.git
cd maigret
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Kali Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
Launching Maigret:

```bash
maigret <username>
```

üî∑ Comparing tools
Use both programs for the same username and compare the results: which tool found more profiles? Which gives more transparent data?

Think about it: were there profiles found on social networks where you didn't expect them?

### üìù Analysis and Report

- Compare the results of Sherlock and Maigret. What differences did you notice?
- Did you find any sensitive information (e.g. email address, private pictures, phone number)? How could the person protect it from being publicly available?

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection and Analysis

- What information was the easiest to find? What was the hardest to find?
- How would you adjust your own online behavior after doing this exercise?
- Do you think the use of OSINT tools is ethically questionable? In which cases is it justified?
