# Exercise 1: Individual Security in Cyberspace

We use cyberspace every day. Examples of cyberspace usage include communication, shopping, banking, as well as work and entertainment. Individuals are users of cyberspace, but at the same time they are also targets and we are often unaware of all the dangers and consequences of our actions.

The aim of the exercises in the course Individual Security in Cyberspace is to introduce students to key concepts of cybersecurity from an individual perspective, develop a sense of risks and vulnerabilities, and equip them with basic knowledge for safer use of modern technologies.

# üß™ Let's get to know cyberspace

The first exercise is intended to introduce cybersecurity and to learn about basic concepts and challenges:

- Who or what is an individual in cyberspace?

- What does the term cyberspace mean and how do we perceive it?

- What do we understand by the term cybersecurity?

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction: Analysis of personal exposure in cyberspace

Exercise objectives:
‚úÖ To learn the basic concepts: individual, cyberspace, cybersecurity, privacy.
‚úÖ To recognize personal data and how it is accessible in the online environment.
‚úÖ To understand how modern technologies affect the security and privacy of an individual.

### Security and privacy

An individual in cyberspace is any user of technologies and devices that are connected to a network and use Internet services.

Security:
Security (cybersecurity) encompasses the protection of ICT systems, networks and data from unauthorized access, attacks, failures or misuse. The purpose is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of data and services.
Example: to prevent hacking into a user's email account.

Privacy:
Privacy concerns the right of a person to have control over their personal data and the way in which it is collected, used, disclosed or stored. It's about how much information a person wants to reveal about themselves and to whom.
Example: the right for a web platform not to share user data with advertisers without consent.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activity: Personal Exposure Analysis

Open the incognito/private mode in your browser and search for information about yourself (e.g. via search engines and exposure checking services):
- Search for your first and last name on Google.
- Check any public profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, forums).
- Use exposure checking tools (HaveIBeenPwned, OSINTLeak)
- Tools: PimEyes, haveibeenpwned, OSINTLeak

### Google dorking/hacking

Google Dorking (also known as Google Hacking) is a method that exploits advanced search operators in Google (or other search engines) to obtain data that is not intended for the public, but is still available online.

It is the exploitation of a misconfigured website, servers or applications where files, documents or even passwords are accessible to the public but hidden from ordinary users.

Google Dorking is not illegal as long as we do not interfere with protected systems. However, the information found must not be misused, stored without permission or disclosed publicly.

### üìò Examples of Google Dork search queries

| Search query | What does it find? |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `filetype:pdf site:gov.si` | PDF documents on Slovenian government websites |
| `intitle:"index of" passwords` | Folders with the name "index of" and files with passwords |
| `inurl:admin login` | Pages with the option to log in to the administration |
| `site:pastebin.com password` | Posts with passwords on Pastebin |
| `"confidential" filetype:pdf` | Documents marked "confidential" in PDF format |
| `ext:sql intext:"password"` | Public SQL files containing passwords |
| `intitle:"webcamXP 5"` | Unprotected IP camera interfaces |
| `inurl:/phpinfo.php` | Public PHP configuration files |
| `filetype:env intext:DB_PASSWORD` | Public `.env` files with database passwords |
| `site:*.* inurl:/config.json` | Public application configuration files |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection and analysis

- Write a short report on what data you found.
- What potential risk does it pose?
- Write a worst-case scenario example of how someone could benefit from this data in the event of personal exposure.
- How would you rate your personal security/privacy?
