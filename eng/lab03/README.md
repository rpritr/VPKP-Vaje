# üß© Exercise 3: MetaOSINT ‚Äì What does a photo reveal?

EXIT (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a standard for storing metadata in image, audio, and other multimedia files. Devices such as digital cameras and mobile phones often store this information in photos.

This exercise is designed to explore the information that can be revealed using **metadata in photos (EXIF)**. Using various tools, we will analyze photos and determine the information that can be revealed using MetOSINT, such as the location and time of the photo, the device, and other hidden data.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction: Gathering information about photos

The objectives of the exercise are:
‚úÖ Understand the importance of metadata in digital photos.
‚úÖ Use OSINT tools to analyze EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãdata.
‚úÖ Assess the risks associated with sharing images online.
‚úÖ Develop critical thinking about privacy and digital footprints.

### MetaOSINT

MetaOSINT is a technique within OSINT (Open Source INTelligence), where we analyze the metadata of files, especially photos, in order to obtain information about the origin, device, author or time of creation.

If a photo contains metadata, we can obtain, for example, GPS data from it and determine the exact location of the photo. Metadata also reveals whether the image has been edited later. We can also obtain information about the author and device from the metadata.

### üîç Tools for analyzing EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãmetadata

There are many tools for analyzing metadata.

The most commonly used tool is exiftool (https://exiftool.org/)

[Documentation and GitHub](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool)

There are also many online tools:
- [https://www.pic2map.com/](https://www.pic2map.com/)
- [https://exif.tools/](https://exif.tools/)
- [Online Exif Viewer](https://onlineexifviewer.com/)

## üñºÔ∏è Using MetaOSINT on photos

We will use a test image with EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãdata included, we will take the photo from the exif-samples collection, but you can also use your own photo, e.g. from a mobile phone

First, let's select a photo:
- [https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples](https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples)
- Or a photo with your own mobile phone (make sure it has the location included).

---

## üìù Instructions

1. **Select a photo with EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãdata**
- It is preferable that this is a photo that was taken with a mobile device with location enabled.

2. **Upload the photo to the online tool**
- Open [https://pic2map.com](https://pic2map.com) or [https://exif.tools](https://exif.tools)
- Upload your test image.
- View the analysis results: GPS, date, time, device, orientation, etc.

3. **Analyze the location**
- If the coordinates are shown, paste them into Google Maps or OpenStreetMap and check the actual location.
- Compare whether the location matches reality.

4. **Analyze the time and device**
- When was the photo taken?
- With which device?
- Are there other interesting data (e.g. orientation, software, etc.)?

---

## üìù Analysis and Report

Answer the following questions:

1. What was the exact location (coordinates and address)?
2. When was the image taken?
3. What other metadata did you notice?
4. What surprised you?
5. What would you recommend to someone who regularly posts images online?

---

## üí¨ Reflection

- Should everyone remove EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãdata before posting an image?
- How can we protect ourselves from the misuse of such information?
- Have you ever posted an image that contained such metadata? What would your reaction be today?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional

- Try using the `exiftool` tool locally in the terminal:
```bash
exiftool image.jpg
```

---

## üìå Important

The purpose of this exercise is not to violate the privacy of others, but to **make you aware of how quickly and easily it is to reveal data from an image** and consequently **learn how to use digital content safely**.

---

## üßº How to remove EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãmetadata

If we want to remove all metadata from an image before publishing it, we have several options:

### üñ•Ô∏è Using `exiftool` (command line)

1. Install the tool:
```bash
sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install exiftool # macOS
```

2. To remove all metadata from an image (create a copy):
```bash
exiftool -all= image.jpg
```

3. To overwrite an existing file:
```bash
exiftool -all= -overwrite_original image.jpg
```
